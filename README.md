# Olive Robotics EdgeROS SOM01-X CAN Carrier Board

## Overview

This repository contains the KiCad project files for a carrier board designed to interface with the Olive Robotics EdgeROS SOM01-X. The carrier board connects via the 2x18 pin connector on the EdgeROS and provides a CAN interface.

## Features

- 2x18 pin connector for interfacing with EdgeROS SOM01-X
- CAN interface
- Designed using KiCad

## Prerequisites

- KiCad 7.0.1 or higher
- Basic understanding of PCB design and electronics
